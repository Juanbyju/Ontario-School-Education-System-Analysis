# Ontario School Education System Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data from various educational sources in Ontario, Canada, to understand patterns and trends in student achievements, demographics, and transitions to postsecondary education. The analysis integrates multiple datasets provided by the Ontario Government, each offering a unique perspective on different aspects of the education system, including:
- School information
- Student demographics
- Academic performance
- Transitions to postsecondary institutions

By combining these datasets, we aim to derive actionable insights that could guide educational policies and strategies for improving student outcomes and educational equity across regions.
